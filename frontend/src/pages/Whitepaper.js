          <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
          <p>
            QuantumChain represents a paradigm shift in blockchain technology, combining 
            post-quantum cryptography with a hybrid Proof of Stake consensus mechanism to 
            create a secure, scalable, and future-proof decentralized platform.

          <h2>Technology Overview</h2>
          
          <h3>Post-Quantum Cryptography</h3>
          <p>
            QuantumChain implements advanced post-quantum cryptographic algorithms including 
            CRYSTALS-Kyber for key encapsulation and SPHINCS+ for digital signatures. These 
            NIST-approved algorithms ensure that the network remains secure even in the face 
            of quantum computing advances.
          </p>

          <h3>Hybrid PoS Consensus</h3>
          <p>
            Our innovative hybrid Proof of Stake mechanism combines traditional PoS with 
            quantum-resistant validator selection, ensuring both energy efficiency and 
            long-term security. Validators stake QCN tokens to participate in block 
            production and earn rewards.
          </p>

          <h3>Decentralized Exchange</h3>
          <p>
            The integrated DEX allows for seamless token trading with automated market 
            making (AMM) and liquidity pools. Trade fees are minimal at 0.3%, with 
            liquidity providers earning proportional rewards.
